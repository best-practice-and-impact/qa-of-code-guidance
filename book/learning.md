# Learning resources

This section links to training and self-led learning resources, which relate to sections of the guidance.

Many of these learning resources point to the UK Statistics Authority Learning Hub. All government analysts can [request an account for the hub](mailto:data.science.campus.faculty@ons.gov.uk).

Please note that learning resources from non-government training providers (i.e. not accessed through the Hub) may not always follow best practice. However, exposure to a range of applied examples will still benefit your learning. You should compare and contrast your learning to the good practices outlined in the guidance.

## Core programming

The [RAP learning pathway](https://learninghub.ons.gov.uk/mod/page/view.php?id=8699) covers training for most of the good practices outlined in this book, with a focus on Python and R. Other courses below can be used to supplement this learning.

## Learing from mistakes

Finally, it is often good to see what not to do and learn from the mistakes of others. The following is a compliation of bad code in Python, but worth a read whatever your language as most apply to R and Python, as well as other languages.
