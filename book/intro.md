# Quality assurance of code for analysis and research

This is an early draft of Analysis Function and Government Statistical Service (GSS) guidance. It is produced by the [Best Practice and Impact division](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/about-us/support-for-the-gss/) of the Office for National Statistics.

This guidance has been written to support analysts in government who use coding in their work. This includes those who produce statistics, carry out modelling or apply data science.

This guidance is a living document, so will be continually updated. You can refer to the current version of the guidance by its version number, found below the site table of contents. You may notice "Todo" notes throughout the guidance. These indicate where we plan to add additional content in the near future. We are extremely grateful for any feedback that you are able to provide on existing and future content.

## Citing the book

The following structure can be used to reference the current version of the book:

> UK Government Analytical Community. (2020). Quality assurance of code for analysis and research (version 2021.3). Office for National Statistics, Best Practice and Impact division: https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/

## How to get the most out of the book

This guidance is tailored to government analysts who would like to quality assure their code and increase the reproducibility of their analyses. We have tried to interpret the requirements of pieces of guidance (the [principles](/principles.md)) into actions and deliverables for analytical programming.

However, the practices outlined in the book are general to many applications of programming, so may also be relevant for those outside of government. This book might be most useful for you if you are:
- writing code to automate part of your work and would like to assure that it is working as expected
- developing a statistical production pipeline and would like to assure that it is sustainable and reproducible
- developing models and would like to assure that they are transparent and reproducible
- developing data science techniques and would like your code to be useful to others
- looking for a high level introduction to software engineering practices in the context of analysis and research

This book can be used to guide your learning and as a reference. Each chapter describes the risks that the described practices may help to address. Therefore, you should strive to apply the most appropriate practices given the risks associated with your work.

The principles in this book are language agnostic. It does not form a comprehensive learning resource and you may often need to study further resources to implement these practices. That said, examples and useful references are provided for **Python** and **R**, as open source languages that are commonly applied across government.

## Accessibility statement

This accessibility statement applies to the Quality assurance of code for analysis and research guidance. Please note that this does not include third-party content that is referenced from this guidance.

The website is managed by the Best Practice and Impact division of the Office for National Statistics. We would like this guidance to be accessible for as many people as possible. This means that you should be able to:
* change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* navigate most of the website using just a keyboard
* navigate most of the website using speech recognition software
* listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)

For keyboard navigation, {kbd}`Up Arrow` and {kbd}`Down Arrow`keys can be used to scroll up and down on the current page. {kbd}`Left Arrow` and {kbd}`Right Arrow` keys can be used to move forwards and backwards through the pages of the book. Tabbed content (including code example) can be focused using the {kbd}`Tab` key. {kbd}`Left Arrow` and {kbd}`Right Arrow` keys are then used to focus the required tab option, where {kbd}`Enter` can be used to select that option and display the associated content.


### Feedback and reporting accessibility problems
