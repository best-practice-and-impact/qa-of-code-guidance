# Code quality assurance checklists

This sections aims to provide a checklist for quality assurance of analytical projects in government.

As per the [Aqua book](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government),
quality assurance should be proportional to the complexity and risk of your analysis.
With this in mind, we have provided checklists for three levels of quality assurance.

We recommend that you consider the risk and complexity associated with your project.
Given this assessment, you should select and tailor the checklists that we have provided.
The values and risk tolerance varies between government departments, so it is important that these are considered when deciding what quality assurance is adequate.
You may choose to select elements from each level of quality assurance to address the specific risks associated with your work.
